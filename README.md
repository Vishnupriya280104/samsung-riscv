**JK Flip-Flop Implementation Using CH32V003F4U6 Microcontroller**
***Overview:***
This project implements a JK flip-flop using the CH32V003F4U6 microcontroller. The flip-flop takes J, K, and Clock inputs and toggles the Q output accordingly. The application demonstrates sequential logic design and real-time signal processing using embedded C. By utilizing the microcontroller's GPIO functionality, the JK flip-flop behavior is controlled and observed through hardware and software interactions. This project serves as an educational experiment for understanding the fundamental concepts of flip-flops, timing control, and state transitions in digital electronics. Additionally, it can be expanded for practical applications such as counters, memory elements, and sequential circuits in embedded systems.
